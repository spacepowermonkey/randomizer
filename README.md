# Mental Randomizer

## What Is This?
Thinking can use up your pool of fresh ideas: this tool helps your brain clean its cache and load itself with brand new entropy.

## How Does It Work?
When your eyes trace the gray dot across the screen back-and-forth for 30+ seconds, it allows your brain to reload its state and reset.

Additionally, the high entropy background loads your brain with sufficient "noise" to create new ideas.

## How to Run?

It's easy:
1. Download repository.
2. From the root directory, type `make render`.
3. Watch the video from `./renders/clips` and focus on tracking the gray dot.

You can repeat steps 2 and 3 whenever you need a mental refresh!
